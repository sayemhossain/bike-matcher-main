        <p className="px-3">
          As stated previously, useState enables you to add state to function
          components. Calling React.useState inside a function component
          generates a single piece of state associated with that component.
          Whereas the state in a class is always an object, with Hooks, the
          state can be any type. Each piece of state holds a single value, which
          can be an object, an array, a boolean, or any other type you can
          imagine. So when should you use the useState Hook? Itâ€™s especially
          useful for local component state, but larger projects might require
          additional state management solutions.
